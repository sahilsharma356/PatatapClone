# PatatapClone

This is a replica of the Patatap web app (https://patatap.com/). The app only replicates the basic
functionality such as:
-having a unique sound for every alphabet key 
-each key has a associated animation that plays out when the key is pressed. 
- The project uses the paper.js javascript library which allows you to animate graphics on a HTML canvas

How to run the project:
Download the repository to your machine and open the circles.html file in Chrome. 

enjoy :)
